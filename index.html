	<h1>About Readability on the Web</h1>
	<h2>An Interactive Guide (to hit The Floor Running)</h2>
	<p><em>Disclaimer: I'm not a (Micro-)Typographer. I did my share of print, editorial and web development to have a
			sense about what works and what not. I looked a Gestalt theory to know some things about the law of proximity and
			others, but in any circumstance I would call myself a master of the trade. I remember just enough to make my pages
			look okay(&mdash;ish). This document is based on several resources from around the web but mainly inspired from a
			talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM2Nj691PMo">&ldquo;Good Typography, Better Apps&rdquo; by Frank
				Rausch @ UIKonf</a> and the <a href="https://jgthms.com/web-design-in-4-minutes/">&ldquo;Web Design in 4
				Minutes&rdquo; site by Jeremy Thomas</a></em>
	</p>
	<p>

		What you see here is, if the checkboxes are not checked, is not unformatted text. It is badly formatted text. The
		narrower your screen is the better it gets but better is not good.
		To make this more readable, we need to consider the following rules.

	<ol>
		<li>Choose a typeface that is easy to read.</li>
		<li>Choose a comfortable text size and tracking.</li>
		<li>Choose a line length that allows the eye to find the next line easily</li>
		<li>Choose a line height sets a good vertical rhythm.</li>
		<li>Create space around the text to keep it in focus.</li>
		<li>Other small tweaks</li>
	</ol>

	</p>
	<h3>Typeface</h3>

	<input type="checkbox" id="font-family">
	<label for="font-family">Typeface (font-family)</label>

	<p>For the first rule we have plenty of possibilities at hand. <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google Fonts</a>
		for example provides many typefaces. Way to much in my humble opinion. I also like to not rely on external resources
		for the first draft. To get started without having to think to much about it, I tend to go to <a
			href="https://modernfontstacks.com/">Modern Font Stacks</a>. These are typefaces that exists on modern computers.
		This means for us we don&rsquo;t need to download a font, place it in the right directory, ship it with our markup
		or load it from a content delivery network (CDN). We can just start writing code. Use the &ldquo;Typeface&rdquo;
		checkbox to see the difference between the default font and the font I chose for this page.

	<pre id="font-family-code" class="hidden"><code>

body {
  font-family: Charter, 'Bitstream Charter', 'Sitka Text', Cambria, serif;
  font-weight: normal;
}
code {
  font-family: ui-monospace, 'Cascadia Code', 'Source Code Pro', Menlo, Consolas, DejaVu Sans Mono', monospace;
  font-weight: normal;
}
</code>
</pre>
	</p>
	<h3>Text Size</h3>

	<input type="checkbox" id="font-size">
	<label for="font-size">Text Size (font-size)</label>


	<p>For the second rule we have to consider the text size and tracking. The text size should be big enough to read but
		not to big to make the reader feel like a child. The tracking should be tight enough to make the text look like a
		whole but not to tight to make it hard to read. Use the &ldquo;Text Size&rdquo; checkbox to see the difference
		between the default text size and the text size I applied to this page. To get a consistent font size I tend to use
		the <code>rem</code> unit. This way I can change the font size for the whole page by changing the
		<code>font-size</code> property of the <code>html</code> element. The tracking is altered by setting the
		<code>letter-spacing</code> to <code>0.01rem</code> for the body text. To learn more about the <code>rem</code>
		unit, read <a href="https://css-tricks.com/theres-more-to-the-css-rem-unit-than-font-sizing/">Chris Coyier&rsquo;s
			article</a> on CSS-Tricks. To adjust the size of the code elements I also applied a different font-size to the
		<code>&lt;code&gt;</code> tag. This makes the height of the monospace characters match the size of the body text.
		This needs to be matched visually. It depends on the typefaces. The <code>font-weight</code> property is set to
		<code>normal</code> to make the text look like a whole. This is the default value but I like to be explicit about
		it.
	<pre id="font-size-code" class="hidden">
<code>
html {
  font-size: 18px;
  letter-spacing: 0.01rem;
}
</code>
</pre>
	</p>

	<h3>Vertical Rhythm</h3>


	<input type="checkbox" id="line-height">
	<label for="line-height">Vertical Rhythm (line-height)</label>

	<p>
		What means vertical rhythm? In the default formatting the lines are to close together. This makes it hard to find
		the next line. The line height should be set to a value that makes it easy to find the next line. Use the
		&ldquo;Vertical Rhythm&rdquo; checkbox to see the difference between the default line height and the line height I
		applied to this page I think creates a better readability. Rule of thumb is <code>1.5</code> times the font size. As
		you can see I use a value without a unit. Unit-less values use this number multiplied by the element's font size.
	<pre id="line-height-code" class="hidden">
<code >
body {
  line-height: 1.55;
}
</code>
</pre>
	</p>

	<h3>Line Length</h3>

	<input type="checkbox" id="line-length">
	<label for="line-length">Line Length (max-width)</label>

	<p>
		The line length in the default formatting is not constrained. Therefor we get as many words as possible per line. In
		the English language the recommended character per line length is between <code>45</code> and <code>75</code>. This
		is a rule of thumb. It depends on the typeface, the font size, the leading the distance to the screen/book/poster.
		The length I used here might also be better suited to a desktop then a handheld device. Even the language the
		document is on might make a difference. My native language German with its long words might need some more space. So
		experiment with this value a little to get the right amount for your publication. Use the &ldquo;Line Length&rdquo;
		checkbox to see the difference between the default line length and the line length I applied to this page. I used
		the <code>max-width</code> property to set the line length. This way the line length is not fixed but constrained to
		a maximum value. I used the <code>ch</code> unit here. This unit is also based on the font size. It is the width of
		the zero character of the element's font.
	<pre id="line-length-code" class="hidden">
	<code >
p {
  max-width: 65ch;
}
	</code>
</pre>
	</p>
	<h3>Outside Space</h3>


	<input type="checkbox" id="margin">
	<label for="margin">Outside Space (margin)</label>

	<p>
		The setting for the line length helps already to create some space in our document but it is not distributed
		equally. The text around the text should be equal on both sides. Here I use the <code>margin</code> property. For a
		document like this one it is enough to set a equal margin for the body on the left and right side. For more complex
		layouts I suggest to reach for such marvelous tools like <a
			href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox">Flexbox</a> <a
			href="#footnote-1"><sup>1</sup></a> or the <a
			href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Grids">Grid</a>. Here we set the
		<code>margin</code> on the body to value <code>0 auto</code>. Which means that on the top and the bottom the margin
		is 0 and on the left and right side the margin is automatically calculated to be equal. Use the &ldquo;Outside
		Space&rdquo; checkbox to see the difference between the default margin and the margin I applied to this page.
	<pre id="margin-code" class="hidden">
<code >
body {
  margin: 0 auto;
}
</code>
</pre>
	</p>

	<h3>Inside Space</h3>

	<input type="checkbox" id="padding">
	<label for="padding">Inside Space (padding)</label>

	<p>
		To create space around the text we can use the <code>padding</code> property. This property creates space inside the
		element. I used the <code>padding</code> property to create space around the text. I set the <code>padding</code> on
		the body to a value of <code>1rem</code>. This way the text is not directly on the edge of the screen. I also give
		the <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> tag some padding on the left and right side to make it differ from the rest of text.
		Use the
		&ldquo;Inside Space&rdquo; checkbox to see the difference between the default padding and the padding I applied to
		this page.

	</p>
	<pre id="padding-code" class="hidden">
	<code>
body, h1, h2, h3 {
  padding: 0.5rem;
}
pre {
  padding: 0 1rem;
}
	</code>
</pre>

	<h3>Small Tweaks</h3>

	<input type="checkbox" id="small-tweaks">
	<label for="small-tweaks">Small Tweaks</label>


	<p>
		The above changes already make a big difference in the readability of the text. But there are some small tweaks that
		can make your text even more readable. I set the <code>color</code> property to a value of <code>#403f53</code>.
		This is a dark grey color. This way the text is not black but still easy to read. I set the
		<code>background-color</code> property to a value of <code>#fbfbfb</code>. This is a light grey color. This way the
		text is not directly on the white background. I also used a gradient as background color for the code elements and a dashed border on the left to make them stand out a little more. Last I changed the appearance of the <code>&lt;hr&gt;</code> tag to be dashed as well. To make my colors reusable I set them as custom properties on the <code>:root</code> element.
		 Use the &ldquo;Small
		Tweaks&rdquo; checkbox to see the difference between the default text and the text I applied to this page.
<pre id="small-tweaks-code" class="hidden">
<code>
:root {
  --body-bg: #fbfbfb;
  --text-color: #403f53;
  --link-color: #0077cc;
  --link-hover-color: #004466;
  --link-visited-color: #440099;
  --link-visited-hover-color: #220066;
  --border-color: #282828;
  --code-bg: #f6f6f6;
  --code-color: #403f53;
  --code-border-color: #282828;
}
body {
  color: var(--text-color);
  background-color: var(--body-bg);
}
pre {
  color: var(--code-color);
  background: linear-gradient(to left, var(--code-bg), var(--body-bg));
  border-left: 1px dashed var(--code-border-color);
}
hr {
  border: 0;
  border-top: 1px dashed var(--border-color);
  margin: 1rem 0;
}
</code>
</pre>
	</p>

	<h3>Conclusion</h3>
	<p>
		These small changes make a big difference in readability. The content is easier to grasp. Of course all these changes only work good together and depend on each other. Just a last note. If you take a look at the source code you will not see the same structure as described in this document. To allow you to toggle the different settings I used JavaScript to apply classes to the elements. Above I show a how you apply the CSS directly to the HTML tags.
