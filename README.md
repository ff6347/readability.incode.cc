for good reading we need 4 parameters:

- Text Size (font size)
- Horizontal Rhythm (spacing between elements)
- Line Length (characters per line)
- Vertical Rhythm (spacing between lines)

These can be expressed in the following CSS properties:

- font-size
- line-height
- max-width
- margin
- padding
